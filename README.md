# 09  Data Science Research Project Importing 6 CSV Database Files from the 1980s -90s to PostgreSQL database and performing data modeling, data engineering, & data analysis processes.
Data Modeling- Inspect the CSV files and create an Entity Relationship Diagram of the CSV tables. Diagrams were created using the QuickDB website tools. Data Engineering: Using the Relationship Diagram and QuickDB code, create a schema for each CSV file that specifies data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. Verify the primary keys column(s) are unique or create a composite key to uniquely identify a row. Create tables in the correct order to properly handle foreign keys. Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table. Data Analysis: Create 8 separate Queries that produce visualization charts to analyze and answer the following: 1. List the employee number, List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee. 2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986. 3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name. 4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name. 5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B. 6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name. 7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name. 8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
